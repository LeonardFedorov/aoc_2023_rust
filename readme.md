Solutions for Advent of Code 2023 written in Rust. No particular paradigm or approach is targeted, beyond striving to have solutions sufficiently general to be able to read input data from any user and not be overfitted to my own.

## Day 1
An annoyingly fiddly start compared with prior years. My solution is inefficient in that it is performing a forwards and backwards search for each digit name string and then checking the returned match indexes (if any). Obviously this is doing more work then a direct parse might, but it still only takes 3ms to execute (with debug symbols) so not that bothered.

## Day 2
At first glance, this looked like it might be a pain but the way string splits in Rust convert directly to loopable iterators actually made it fairly easy to work with. A key idea which made this whole thing easier was to associate the colours to index values so they could be referenced numerically. This day's solution also forced me to modify the time code to display the readout in microseconds rather than milliseconds when the time is short...

## Day 3
The classic return of the "search a 2d array looking for things and reasoning about their neighbours". This brings with it the ugly case analysis of handling not reading out of bounds on the array and such like. As such the solution isn't pretty, but it at least works and I think is reasonably efficient. The gears aren't handled during the initial iteration, but their locations are marked a second map with the actual numbers marked on it is built during the part 1 iteration to make calculating part 2 fairly quick.

## Day 4
An easier puzzle than the previous days, although my initial iterator for loop for part 1 wasn't as compatible with part 2 so had to fall back with a indexed for loop over a vector. This was one of the ones where understanding the puzzle took longer than actually building the code to solve it.

## Day 5
Part 2 of this day contained a classic AoC brute force trap, which my initial solution fell right into. This was optimised by implementing a lookahead which assessed the level of "headroom" on each range to determine how many seeds could be skipped for having a known same result. The end result was very fast, running in roughly half a millisecond with debug symbols.
